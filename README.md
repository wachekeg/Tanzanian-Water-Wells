# Tanzania Water Well Project
## Introduction
This project aims to utilize machine learning and data visualization to identify potential issues with existing water well projects, forecast the success of new initiatives, and allocate funds strategically for maximum impact in areas where urgent intervention is needed.

## Problem Statement
While recognizing Tanzania's recent efforts to enhance clean water accessibility, the UN-Habitat acknowledges that a significant portion of the population still lacks safe water access. To address this, an initiative is being proposed to evaluate the distribution of wells in Tanzania and assess the functionality of water pumps in existing wells. The wells in Tanzania can be categorized as functional, non-functional, or in need of repair.


## Objectives

### Primary Objective:
- Deliver accurate predictions regarding the operational status of wells.

### Specific Objectives:
- Determine the quality of water in Tanzania.
- Identify the top 5 installers of water wells in Tanzania.
- Analyze functionality status with respect to payment type.
- Assess the condition of waterpoint pumps based on age.
- Identify installers resulting in the most nonfunctional waterpoint pumps.
- Determine the most popular extraction type.

## Data Understanding
The target variable in this dataset is status_group with labels:
- functional: The waterpoint is operational, and no repairs are needed.
- functional needs repair: The waterpoint is operational but needs repairs.
- non-functional: The waterpoint is not operational.

Libraries used include pandas, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves visualizing data distributions, identifying missing values, and analyzing correlations between features. It provides an initial understanding of the data's characteristics, guiding more in-depth analyses and modeling.

## Preprocessing
Data preprocessing was performed to handle outliers and prepare the data for regression, including model fitting.

## Classification Models
Various classification models such as  Decision Tree, Dummy Model, Logistic Regression, Grid Search, Random Forest, and XGBClassifier were employe

## Conclusions
The top-performing model is the baseline XGBClassifier, demonstrating a training accuracy of 85.84% and a test accuracy of 82.09%. Minimal overfitting is observed, with a commendable cross-validation score of 0.819. This model's ability to generalize effectively to new data aligns with the predefined success criteria.

## Recommendations
1. Deploy the baseline XGBClassifier as the preferred model.
2. Prioritize repairing non-functional wells to avoid multiple concurrent problems.
3. Distribute wells strategically to prevent overpopulation in specific areas.
4. Utilize the predictive model to prioritize waterpoints according to needs.

## Next Steps
Integrate maintenance records to reflect repairs made to waterpoints, preventing repeated classification as needing repairs. Explore additional classifiers to prioritize maintenance for non-functional waterpoints.
